This is a messenger app we were required to build for an assignment.
We had to be able to send and receive real time messages. We were given 100%, as the project was for a simple messenger app.
We used firebase along with python and some libraries, the gui is really simple and loading is often slow.
The assignment had some restrictions, we had to make it a standalone executable that would work on any computer, even computers without browsers etc.
This made it more challenging, but this was also the first full-stack application we built, I am not overly proud of the end product, the listeners I used dont function perfectly. Time was an issue and i never corrected that.
